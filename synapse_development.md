### [regulation of synapse assembly ; GO:0051963](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0051963#term=annotation)
* __def:__"Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of synapse assembly, the aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form a synapse." [GOC:ai, GOC:pr]
* __synonym:__"regulation of synapse biogenesis" EXACT []
* __synonym:__"regulation of synaptogenesis" EXACT []

### [synapse maturation ; GO:0060074](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0060074#term=annotation)
* __def:__"The process that organizes a synapse so that it attains its fully functional state. Synaptic maturation plays a critical role in the establishment of effective synaptic connections in early development." [GOC:dph, GOC:ef]
* __synonym:__"synaptic maturation" EXACT []

### [postsynaptic membrane assembly ; GO:0097104](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0097104#term=annotation)
* __def:__"The aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form a postsynaptic membrane, a specialized area of membrane facing the presynaptic membrane on the tip of the nerve ending and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft)." [GOC:BHF, GOC:sjp, PMID:21424692]
* __synonym:__"post-synaptic membrane assembly" EXACT []

### [presynaptic membrane assembly ; GO:0097105](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0097105#term=annotation)
* __def:__"The aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form a presynaptic membrane, a specialized area of membrane of the axon terminal that faces the plasma membrane of the neuron or muscle fiber with which the axon terminal establishes a synaptic junction." [GOC:BHF, GOC:sjp, PMID:15797875, PMID:18550748]

### [postsynaptic density assembly ; GO:0097107](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0097107#term=annotation)
* __def:__"The aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form a postsynaptic density, a region that lies adjacent to the cytoplasmic face of the postsynaptic membrane at excitatory synapse." [GOC:BHF, GOC:sjp, PMID:21525273]
