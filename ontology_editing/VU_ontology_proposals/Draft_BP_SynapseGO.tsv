	local translation						
		presynaptic local translation					
		postsynaptic local translation					
							
	synaptic transmission, presynaptic process						
							
		synaptic vesicle process					
			synaptic vesicle trafficking				does 'trafficking' belong to synaptic transmission??, what to do with the other items that are trafficked to the presynapse??
				anterograde synaptic vesicle trafficking			
				retrograde synaptic vesicle trafficking			
			synaptic vesicle maturation				
				synaptic vesicle lumen acidification			
				synaptic vesicle loading			
					synaptic vesicle loading, amines		
					... (other transmitters are also loaded)		
				synaptic vesicle clustering			according to http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/10099709
			synaptic vesicle exocytosis				
				... synaptic vesicle clustering			??? (see above)
				synaptic vesicle docking			
				synaptic vesicle priming			
				synaptic vesicle fusion with presynaptic membrane			
					synaptic vesicle fusion with presynaptic membrane, synchronous		
					synaptic vesicle fusion with presynaptic membrane, asynchronous		
					synaptic vesicle fusion with presynaptic membrane, spontaneous		
			synaptic vesicle recycling				
				synaptic vesicle endocytosis			
					synaptic vesicle budding from presynaptic membrane		
						synaptic vesicle coating	
					synaptic vesicle uncoating		
				synaptic vesicle endosome recycling			
					synaptic vesicle to endosome fusion		
					synaptic vesicle budding from endosome membrane		
				... is 'synaptic vesicle maturation' part of the recycling??			
							
		neurotransmitter reuptake					
		transsynaptic signaling, presynaptic					
			... can happen with secreted substances/receptors				
			... can happen with TM proteins				
		synapse alignment, presynaptic					how different from adhesion??
		synaptic membrane adhesion, presynaptic					how different from alignment??
							... What to do with voltage gated calcium channels? --> are involved in SV secretion, but may get their own level?
							
							
							
	synaptic transmission, postsynaptic process						
							
		TN receptor process					
			NT receptor modulation				i guess this category EXcludes the NT receptors itself
			NT receptor clustering				Def: organization of NT receptors into larger assemblies that are trafficked or localized together
			NT receptor localization				Def: lateral organization of NT receptors that are present in the postsynaptic membrane
			NT receptor trafficking				Does 'trafficking' belong to synaptic transmission??, what to do with the other items that are trafficked to the postsynapse??
				anterograde neurotransmitter receptor trafficking			
				retrograde neurotransmitter receptor trafficking			
				insertion of neurotranmitter receptor into postsynaptic membrane			
					insertion of neurotranmitter receptor into postsynaptic membrane, constituitive		
					insertion of neurotranmitter receptor into postsynaptic membrane, activity dependent		
							
							
		regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential					includes all ion channels; this category INcludes the NT receptors
							
			generation of action potential				
				regulation of ... is then 'excitability' 			Def: the ability to elicit an AP after membrane depolarization
				voltage-gated sodium channels??? 			
			postsynaptic membrane depolerization				
			postsynaptic membrane hyperpolerization				
							
							
		dendritic spine morphology					Aka structural plasticity. Def: change of the shape of the dendritic spine. This has consequences for the trafficking and distribution of synaptic gene products. This in turn affects the biochemical and electrical signaling properties of the synapse.
							
		synapse alignment, postsynaptic					
		transsynaptic signaling, postsynaptic					
			... can happen with secreted substances/receptors				
			... can happen with TM proteins				
		synaptic membrane adhesion, postsynaptic					
							
							
synaptic plasticity 							I see this as a large container concept that contains many 'regulation of ....' terms.
	synaptic plasticity, short term						
	synaptic plasticity, long term						
		long term potentiation					
			regulation of ... (local??) translation				
			regulation of ... NT receptor clustering				
			regulation of ... NT receptor localization				
			.... 				
		long term depression					
							
synapse development							
							
	extrasynaptic modulation of synapse formation						
	target recognition during synapse formation						
	synaptic adhesion during synapse formation						
	presynaptic assembly during synapse formation						
	postsynaptic assembly during synapse formation						
	synapse maturation						
	synapse maintenance						I am unsure whether 'maintenance' and 'elimination' are in fact two different terms. 'elimination' appears to be more like 'negative regulation of maintainance' ??
	synapse elimination						
		synapse elimination, activity dependent 					
		synapse elimination, activity independent
